## Bucket sort
Bucket sort is a comparison sort algorithm that operates on elements by dividing them into different buckets and then sorting these buckets individually. Each bucket is sorted individually using a separate sorting algorithm or by applying the bucket sort algorithm recursively.
## Quick sort
Similar to merge sort in C, quick sort in C follows the principle of decrease and conquer, or as it is often called, divide and conquer. The quicksort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot point, and thereafter partitioning the number set, or array, around the pivot point.
## Bubble sort
Bubble Sort in C. ... Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm in which each element is compared with adjacent element and swapped if their position is incorrect. It is named as bubble sort because same as like bubbles the lighter elements come up and heavier elements settle down.
## Heap sort
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.
## Insertion sort
Insertion sort is based on the idea that one element from the input elements is consumed in each iteration to find its correct position i.e, the position to which it belongs in a sorted array. It iterates the input elements by growing the sorted array at each iteration.
## Radix sort
Radix sort is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value (place value).
## Merge sort
An array with 1 element is always sorted. An example of merge sort in C is given below. First divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.
## Selection sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
